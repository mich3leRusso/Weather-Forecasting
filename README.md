# Weather-Forecasting


Weather forecasting aims to predict atmospheric conditions such as temperature, precipitation, wind, and humidity over a given time horizon by analyzing historical and real-time meteorological data. Modern forecasting systems combine physical models with data-driven approaches, leveraging machine learning to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns that are difficult to model explicitly.

Accurate weather prediction plays a crucial role in agriculture, transportation, energy management, and disaster preparedness, enabling informed decision-making and risk mitigation.

## Repository Aim 

This repository provides a simple yet effective pipeline for training a weather forecasting model on the AIMSIR dataset. The workflow begins with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which is used to understand the structure and characteristics of the data.

EDA helps identify patterns, detect anomalies, and guide data transformations, enabling informed decisions on how to preprocess and model the data effectively. This step is essential for selecting suitable features and ensuring reliable forecasting performance.
